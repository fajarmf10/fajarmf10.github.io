Fajar Maulana Firdaus is a student in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya. He is friendly and willing to help his friends in any way. He loves coding as much as he love music. He used to love playing some sports, but with his current body, he temporary hates it.

He loves to discuss everything, from a nonsense bullshit to something bigger. He also knows a lot of technology stacks.

Wait, did I ever say that he loves watching movies? Yes, he does.
